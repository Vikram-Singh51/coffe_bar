Hii guys 
feeling so proud 😀👨🏼‍💻
I have completed a landing page for cofee bar shop

Problem I face
In CSS universal selecetor I applied padding 0;

and this creating problem in list style.

List style was not working. So I take help from stackoverflow

and find out

due to padding reset, the numbers are actually off to the left of the page (in order list or unodered list )

If you guys have any suggestion for me . You are most welcome and I will feel privileged. 

Thankyou for visiting my Github.😊
